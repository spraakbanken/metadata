    <td>Abstract*</td>
    <td>The Swedish analogy test set follows the format of the original Google version. However, it is bigger and balanced across the 2 major categories, having a total of 20,638 samples, made up of 10,381 semantic and 10,257 syntactic samples. It is also roughly balanced across the syntactic subsections. There are 5 semantic subsections and 6 syntactic subsections. The dataset was constructed, partly using the samples in the English version, with the help of tools dedicated to Swedish translation and it was proof-read for corrections by two native speakers (with a percentage agreement of 98.93\%).

    <td>Total of 20,638 samples; 10,381 semantic samples and 10,257 syntactic samples. Those are split into 2045 train samples and 18,593 test samples. No effort was made to control the balance of syntactic and semantic samples in train and test, the split was random.
