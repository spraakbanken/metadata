          Each entry in the resource contains a word, its part-of-speech tag
          (SUC-style), and a number of frequencies over different readability
          levels. Multi-word expressions are denoted by multiple words linked by
          underscores.

          NyponVilja förlag. The books were OCR-scanned from PDF-format and
          preprocessed by the authors. Unfortunately, the book dataset is not
          publicly available due to copyright reasons.

          The books contain words that when taken out of context can be seen as
          offensive. The authors have manually removed such entries, but can not
          guarantee that the resource is completely devoid of offensive words.

          This version contain more entries than described in the original paper.
          This is due to two reasons: 1) An increased number of books available for
          the source material (from 247 to 280). 2) An updated method to filter out
          bad entries due to erraneous OCR-readings from the soruce PDFs. In
          practice, this means that the number of entries (unique words) of the
          resource is signifcantly larger (more than double the number of entries)
          in this version, since entries that only appear once in the source
          material are no longer discarded. However, for the total frequency counts
          for all entries, the difference between this updated version and the paper
          version is only around 2%.
