evaluation_results: |-
  For a model trained on SUC3 and validated on a part of TalbankenSBX_dev the results are as follows:  
  tested on Talbanken SBX_test: exact match = 0.97; POS = 0.98; msd = 0.99  
  tested on SIC2: exact match = 0.92; POS = 0.93; msd = 0.96

    In 2020, the Stanza tool was trained and tested on a set of gold-standard
    Swedish corpora (following SUC3-style annotation) in order to create a
    high-quality analysis. Currently (in 2024), this is the default analysis
    for Swedish in Sparv
