caveats:
  swe: ''
  eng: Data collection is limited to a small geographical area and a short period
    of time. Although several language backgrounds are represented, the corpus is
    very unbalanced in this sense and as a consequence not well suited for native
    language identification tasks.The corpus consists of three subcorpora, each coming
    from a different source, with different proficiency levels, and with different
    colleciton periods. While the three subcorpora can be used simultaneously, care
    should be taken into account to ensure that artifacts from these differences do
    not leak into models.
