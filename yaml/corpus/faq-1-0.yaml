    <td>Abstract*</td>
    <td>This dataset contains questions and answers collected from FAQs on the websites of Swedish authorities (Försäkringskassan, Skatteverket, Vårdguiden). The dataset is a part of the SuperLim collection. Each QA pair belongs to a certain category (e.g. "Förälder :: Väntar barn :: Föräldrapenning innan barnet fötts :: Vanliga frågor"). The are 513 QA pairs and 50 categories. The number of QA pairs in a category strongly varies. Within each category, the answers are randomly shuffled. The task is to match questions and answers.

    <td>Nature of the content*</td>
    <td>Each QA pair belongs to a certain category (e.g. "Förälder :: Väntar barn :: Föräldrapenning innan barnet fötts :: Vanliga frågor"). Within each category, the answers are randomly shuffled. Importantly, the shuffling always occurs only within categories. This is necessary, since many questions cannot be interpreted without the background provided by the category (e.g. "Måste bilen registreras i mitt namn?" from the category "Förälder :: Om ditt barn har en funktions­nedsättning :: Bilstöd för barn :: Vanliga frågor"). Moreover, different categories can potentially contain similar questions ("Hur mycket pengar får jag?")  with different answers.

Categories that contained less than two suitable QA pairs were excluded. The contents of the websites were not exhausted, more categories are available. Sometimes different categories contained identical or nearly identical QA pairs, in such cases all instances but one were deleted (if only the questions were similar, but the answers were different, the pair was kept).
