    <td>Data collection method(s)*</td>
    <td>Train and dev: see [1]. Test: SweFracas (part of the SuperLim 1.0). The original English Fracas [2] was converted to html and edited by Bill MacCartney [3], and then automatically translated to Swedish by Peter Ljunglöf and Magdalena Siverbo [4]. The current form of the set was created by Aleksandrs Berdicevskis by merging the Swedish and English versions and removing some of the problems. Finally, Lars Borin went through all the translations, correcting and Swedifying them manually. As a result, many translations are rather liberal and diverge noticeably from the English original

    <tr>
    <td>Data selection and filtering*</td>
    <td>Train and dev: We keep only the mismatched validation as a dev set and do not include the matched version. We also do not include the test MNLI datasets. Test: 41 problems in the original set did not have a definite answer (different answers were possible depending on the interpretation). They were excluded.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Data preprocessing*</td>
    <td>Train and dev: see [1]. All extra column labels except for hypothesis (sentence1), premise (sentence2) have been removed for this data source.  Test: SweFracas used questions (Ja/Nej/Vet ej/Jo) instead of hypotheses. Questions were semi-automatically converted to hypotheses by Aleksandrs Berdicevskis to fit the train and dev format.
    </td>

    <tr>
    <td>Data labeling*</td>
    <td>Train and dev: see [1]. Test: Most of the labels map straightforwardly on the original English labels, with one exception: 108 (No <=> Neutral)

    <td>Things to watch out for</td>
    <td>Train and dev: see [1]. Remember that the data were machine-translated. Test: In the original dataset, all examples were classified by the linguistic phenomena they represent. It is not necessary that the Swedish translations follow exactly the same classification (most of them probably do, but it has not been checked).
