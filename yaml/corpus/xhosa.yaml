      <b>The Corpus of Spoken isiXhosa</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corpus of Spoken isiXhosa consists of transcribed and annotated recordings of spoken Xhosa [xho]. The recordings have been made in the Eastern Cape in South Africa from 2015 onwards. The transcribed texts are annotated with morpheme-by-morpheme glosses, part-of-speech tags, and free English translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recordings and the annotations of Xhosa data have been made as part of three different research projects led by senior lecturer Eva-Marie Bloom Ström at the University of Gothenburg. All projects, including the ongoing ‘How do words get in order? The role of speaker-hearer interaction in languages of southern Africa’, were founded by the Swedish Research Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corpus has been developed in collaboration with Språkbanken Text.

      A user guide and more extensive information about the corpus data can be found in the Corpus of Spoken isiXhosa Manual [PDF].
