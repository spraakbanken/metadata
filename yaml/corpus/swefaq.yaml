    <td>"This dataset contains questions and answers collected from FAQs on the websites of Swedish authorities. The dataset is a part of the SuperLim collection. Each QA pair belongs to a certain category (e.g. "Förälder :: Väntar barn :: Föräldrapenning innan barnet fötts :: Vanliga frågor"). The are 976  QA pairs and 100 categories. The number of QA pairs in a category strongly varies. Within each category, the answers are randomly shuffled. The task is to match questions and answers."

    <td>Nature of the content*</td>
    <td>"Each QA pair belongs to a certain category (e.g. "Förälder :: Väntar barn :: Föräldrapenning innan barnet fötts :: Vanliga frågor"). Within each category, the answers are randomly shuffled. Importantly, the shuffling always occurs only within categories. This is necessary, since many questions cannot be interpreted without the background provided by the category (e.g. "Måste bilen registreras i mitt namn?" from the category "Förälder :: Om ditt barn har en funktions­nedsättning :: Bilstöd för barn :: Vanliga frågor"). Moreover, different categories can potentially contain similar questions ("Hur mycket pengar får jag?")  with different answers."
    </td>

    <tr>
    <td>Format*</td>
    <td>JSON Lines, with one item per line. Each item contains a category id, a question, an array of all answers in this category (this value is the same for all items within a category) and a label index which indicates the correct answer (numbering starts at 0). Metadata included for each item (the title of the category, the source and the link to the page where the data were collected) are intended for analysis, and not for use by the question-answering system. The dataset is also available as a tsv with self-explanatory column names.

Categories that contained less than two suitable QA pairs were excluded. The contents of the websites were not exhausted, more categories are available. Sometimes different categories contained identical or nearly identical QA pairs, in such cases all instances but one were deleted (if only the questions were similar, but the answers were different, the pair was kept).
