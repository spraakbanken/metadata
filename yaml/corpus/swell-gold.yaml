annotation:
  swe: ''
  eng: Essays are manually pseudonymized, normalized and correction annotated for
    ortographical, lexical, morphological, syntactical and punctuation errors according
    to the guidelines available at [1]. Essays are also linguistically annotated (POS
    tagging, lemmatization, dependency annotation) with Sparv. Personal learner metadata
    is also available.
keywords:
  - L2 Swedish
  - second language
  - language learning
  - essays
caveats:
  swe: ''
  eng: Data collection is limited to a small geographical area and a short period
    of time. Although several language backgrounds are represented, the corpus is
    very unbalanced in this sense and as a consequence not well suited for native
    language identification tasks.
