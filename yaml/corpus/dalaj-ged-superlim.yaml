    <td>Abstract*</td>
    <td>Dalaj v2.0 is an extension of Dalaj v1 [4], covering 30 error categories used in the SweLL-gold corpus [3]. Dalaj v2 is prepared for several sentence-level classification tasks, including linguistic acceptability (whether a sentence is grammatically correct or incorrect). The dataset contains ca 20K sentences written by non-native learners of Swedish, manipulated to contain one error per sentence and repeated for every new error. Each learner-written sentence is associated with information about the level of proficiency as assessed on an essay level and with mother tongue of the writer. Each incorrect (learner-written) sentence is paired with their manually corrected versions, which due to the one-error-per-sentence principle amounts to ca 6,5K unique correct sentences repeated multiple times times. To balance the number of incorrect sentences with equivalent number of correct ones, sentences from a course book corpus COCTAILL [2] have been extracted, keeping the same distribution into beginner-intermediate-advanced levels as among the incorrect sentences. Each COCTAILL sentence contains information about the (approximate) level of the coursebook at which the text is used for teaching. The dataset is split into training-validation-test sets. The test split has been manually proofread. Note that Dalaj-ged-superlim may be different from other version of Dalaj v2, see Section III for a description of changes.

When preparing the Superlim version, further filtering was applied: all sentences containing the * (the origin of this token was unclear), @ in the beginning of a sentence (denotes an omitted token) or $ (unintelligible symbol) were deleted. If @ occurred not in the beginning of sentence, the symbol itself was removed, but the sentence was preserved. The annotation was adjusted accordingly."
